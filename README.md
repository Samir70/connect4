# Connect 4

## Why another game?
Well, I like them!

As part of my application to be on [Chingu Voyage 9](https://chingu.gitbook.io/chingu-handbook-voyage-9/cohort-guide/pre-work), I am building a connect 4 project. The minumum requirement is that it be two-player and recognise a win/draw. I will try to get a random move generator for the computer to be one of the players. And, longterm, I will improve the level of play.

This will put me on tier two. 

# Chingu intro

## Background
I currently work as a maths lecturer at college, but no longer feel like I am learning or growing in this career. I am learning modern coding techniques because I find it an enjoyable challenge. 

## Coding History 
I started programming in Basic on a Commodore 64. Yes, I am that old. I also have a vague memory of peek and poke. I could not manage machine code now! I also learnt Pascal, which lead on to Delphi as things modernised. I still have some of my Delphi programs. I uploaded them to a [blog post](https://practise4progress.weebly.com/home/some-programmes-i-wrote-about-10-years-ago). (Never really got into that habit).

My most recent learning has been JavaScript and React.

## Coding Goals 
My aim is to get a job where I can feel I am developing skills and becoming an expert in something I enjoy -- I feel like I am growing as an amateur, but going pro will turbo-charge that.

## Chingu History
First voyage. Hoping to make some contacts and find out what I should learn next to get ahead.

## Strengths
I've always been good at learning from a variety of sources. I don't always get things quickly, but I get them. I'm fairly flexable in my thinking and can change my mind -- even if I have begun down one road and need to change direction. 

I respond well to criticism, and try to keep my own feedback friendly.

## Projects
[Lights-out](https://samir70.github.io/lights-out/) is my favourite project so far. I would do it differently already. But I don't even think that version is finished. It works, but there are a hundred things I could add or improve.
