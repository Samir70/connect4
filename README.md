This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

As part of my application to be on [Voyage 9](https://chingu.gitbook.io/chingu-handbook-voyage-9/cohort-guide/pre-work), I am building a connect 4 project. The minumum requirement is that it be two-player and recognise a win/draw. I will try to get a random move generator for the computer to be one of the players. And, longterm, I will improve the level of play.
